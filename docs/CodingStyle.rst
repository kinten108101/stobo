* Use short, concise variable names. Use IIFEs to scope variables.
* Use only constant variables (const). Use IIFEs to initialize constant variables conditionally.
* Prefer anonymous types. Define types in variables / return type of functions, then reuse these types by typeof. Don't extract these types into named types.
* Write as much in a single file as possible, however long the code may get.
* Prefer functional programming whenever possible.
